An (unfinished) implementation of Japanese Richii Mahjong for GNU Emacs. Currently uses the unicode Mahjong tile characters, rather than any bespoke SVG UI.

## Implementation
I like to think that richii.el is reasonably well documented, or laid out intuitively enough in parts to not need much in the way of docstrings. Just read the file from the Tile Functions section onwards.

## Things to do
* Yaku and Scoring functions
* Full UI Major mode
* Gameplay loop for Major mode
* Player AI and/or Multiplayer
